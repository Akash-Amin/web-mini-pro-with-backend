	What is Civil Engineering?
  
	Civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design, construction and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment. To put simply, civil engineers build bridges, roads, canals, dams, tall buildings, and other large structures.
  
	Civil engineering is all about creating, improving and protecting the environment in which we live. It provides the facilities for day-to-day life and for transport and industry to go about its work.
  
	Civil Engineers are concerned with all types of structures including dams, bridges, pipelines, roads, towers and buildings. They are responsible for the design and construction of all our transport systems, the design and management of our gas and water supply, sewerage systems, harbours, airports and railways. Civil Engineers plan, design and test the structures of private and public buildings and facilities.
